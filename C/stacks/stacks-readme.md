Stack is a LIFO(Last In First Out) structure.

It is an ordered list of the same type of elements, it is also a linear list where all the insertions and deletions are permitted only at one end of the list.

When elements are added to the stack it grows at one end, and when elements are deleted from the stack it shrinks at the same end.
